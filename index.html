        <p>As a Science teacher, my goal is to encourage my students to think in a rational manner. As we move from a culture where our students were often taught rote memorization of facts, my aim is to encourage my students to analyze trends and
          make real-life connections with whatever content they are engaged with. My passion for teaching and learning has been fueled by a love of technology. As a technology leader, I bring to the table a unique set of skills and knowledge that can be
          effectively used to transform traditional learning. This environment would be one where students take charge of their learning and think critically as they utilize technology tools to create digital artifacts of their knowledge.</p>
